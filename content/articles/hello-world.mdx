# Hello World

This is my first article. You can write articles using **MDX**, which combines Markdown with React components.

## Features

- Full Markdown support
- Code syntax highlighting
- React components in your content

## Example Code

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

## What's Next

Start writing your own articles by creating `.mdx` files in the `content/articles/` directory.
